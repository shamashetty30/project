AIM: To provide accessible and continuous remote monitoring of a personâ€™s cardiac health.

OBJECTIVE:

*Early Detection of Cardiac Issues

*Remote Patient Monitoring

*Low-Resource Settings

*Reducing Healthcare Costs

*Education and Research

FEATURES:

*Develop a Wearable Heart Monitoring Device:

Design a compact and wearable device capable of continuous ECG monitoring using the ESP32 and AD8232.

*Real-Time ECG Signal Processing:

Implement real-time signal processing algorithms to filter noise and extract meaningful ECG data for accurate heart rate calculation.

*Wireless Data Transmission:

Enable wireless data transmission from the monitoring device to a connected device (e.g., smartphone, computer) for real-time display and analysis.

*Heart Rate Calculation Algorithm:

Develop and optimize algorithms to calculate the user's heart rate based on the processed ECG signals.

*User Alerts for Abnormalities:

Implement an alert system to notify users in real-time of irregular heartbeats or abnormal ECG patterns, promoting early detection of potential health issues.

*Data Logging and Storage:

Create a data logging feature to store ECG data over time, facilitating historical analysis and tracking of changes.

*Cloud Integration:

Integrate cloud storage for ECG data, allowing users to access their information from multiple devices and enabling remote monitoring by healthcare professionals.

*Bluetooth Connectivity:

Develop power-saving features to optimize battery life, including sleep modes and low-power states, particularly for wearable applications.

*User Authentication and Privacy:

Implement user authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to ECG data and prioritize user privacy in compliance with relevant regulations.

*Intuitive User Interface:

Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for displaying real-time ECG data, heart rate, and historical trends.

*Customizable Settings:

Provide users with customizable settings, such as monitoring duration, alert thresholds, and display preferences, to enhance the user experience.

*Integration with Health Platforms:

Explore integration with existing health platforms or applications, allowing users to sync ECG data with other health-related metrics for a comprehensive health profile.

*Offline Mode and Local Data Storage:

Include an offline mode that stores a certain amount of data locally, enabling users to access their ECG history even without an internet connection.

*Open-Source Collaboration:

Foster open-source collaboration by making the project's codebase accessible to the developer community, encouraging contributions and improvements.

*Educational Resources:

Provide educational resources within the application to help users understand their ECG data, promoting heart health awareness and informed decision-making

COMPONENTS REQUIRED:

*ESP32 Board

*AD8232 ECG sensor

*ECG Electrode connector with plastic patches

*Connecting wires
