WORKING:

ECG Sensor: Connect an ECG sensor to the ESP32 to capture electrical signals from the heart.

Signal Processing: Use the ESP32 to process the raw ECG signals. You may need to filter, amplify, and digitize the signals for further analysis.

Heart Rate Calculation: Analyze the processed signals to calculate the heart rate. This could involve detecting R-peaks in the ECG waveform.

Display on LCD: Use the ESP32 to send the heart rate information to the LCD for real-time display. The LCD can show whether the heart condition is good or bad based on predefined thresholds or algorithms.

User Interface: Implement user interaction via buttons or a touchscreen if needed. Users may want to start/stop monitoring or view historical data.

Communication: Optionally, you can add features to send data to a remote server or a mobile app for more comprehensive monitoring.
